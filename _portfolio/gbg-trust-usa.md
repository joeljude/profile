## Platform Overview

GBG Trust USA represents a paradigm shift in fraud detection, moving from siloed, company-specific solutions to collaborative, cross-industry intelligence sharing. This innovative platform was designed and developed under Joel Sequeira's leadership at GBG IDology.

## Key Innovations

**Consortium Network**: Leverages data from over 650 brands across 28 sectors, providing enterprises with unprecedented visibility into cross-industry fraud patterns.

**30 Billion Configurations**: Offers 30 billion unique attribute monitoring configurations, enabling businesses to create highly specific rules tailored to their fraud use cases.

**Real-Time Intelligence**: Monitors transactions at the application stage for early detection of fraudulent behavior with instant notifications across the network.

## Technical Architecture

**Advanced Analytics**: Combines AI, human intelligence, and data analytics in a layered defense strategy that empowers enterprises to make informed decisions.

**Flexible Rules Engine**: Customers can translate complex fraud patterns into automated detection rules with sophisticated correlation capabilities.

**Cross-Industry Correlation**: Identifies when fraudsters use stolen or manipulated identities across multiple industries but vary other elements like email addresses.

## Use Cases & Applications

**Synthetic Identity Detection**: Effectively tracks probable synthetic identities where fraudsters use the same SSN but create new identities with different names and addresses.

**Cross-Industry Fraud**: Catches bad actors who steal identities to open bank accounts, file fraudulent tax refunds, or acquire prepaid cards across multiple sectors including:
- Financial services and banking
- Tax services and insurance  
- Gaming, gambling, and lottery
- Cryptocurrency platforms

**Pattern Recognition**: Monitors suspicious activities like the same identity associated with different dates of birth at the same address or single mobile numbers linked to multiple individuals.

## Business Impact

**Risk Reduction**: Enables transparent monitoring of fraud patterns and detection of repeated use of identity data across industries.

**Cost Optimization**: Helps organizations optimize costs by providing early-stage risk assessment before investing in expensive verification processes.

**Regulatory Compliance**: Provides complete transparency through configurable rules, essential for heavily regulated industries.

## Industry Recognition

**Strategic Importance**: Featured in GBG Group's preliminary results announcement to the London Stock Exchange as a critical advancement in their Identity solutions portfolio.

**Competitive Advantage**: The platform's unique combination of consortium network and customizable velocity rules provides capabilities no competitor offered at launch.

**Market Position**: Significantly enhanced GBG IDology's value proposition, particularly to enterprise customers, leading to deeper penetration in key markets.
